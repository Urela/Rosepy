- Do you like machine learning? Dogecoin? Stonks? Roses? ...Well **Rosepy** Is **another**
  small machine learning library written in pure Numpy (educational purpose only).

- I wrote this library with the goal of learnig neural networks. Inspired by https://github.com/ShubhangDesai/krikos
  implementations, I added the im2col operation to optimize computation. I also drive most of the modules into 
  one file so as to make it easier to build more complex modules on top of them.
- The library is not tested but the modules work perfectly. I haven't made time and the MNIST Loader broke.
- SO what should you take from RosePy. take the classes like convolution and im2col and added them to your own projects.
  (fine example of object oriented programming)
- I also recently learnt that googlecolab is a thing so..... clone it there and have fun. PLEASE MAKE PULL REQUESTS

## Dependencies

- Numpy 
- Pickle

## TODO
- Save and load pretrained paramters
- Add CUDA or OpenCL support to improve 'speed'
- Add more dataset samples for training - CIFAR10.
- Add more network topologies - YOLOnet, ResNet.
- Add Adam or AdamW optimizers
